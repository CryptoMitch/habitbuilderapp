# habitbuilderapp
This app helps users develop small, healthy habits in their daily lives, leading to a more balanced and productive lifestyle. It's based on the concept that small, consistent actions can lead to significant long-term improvements.

**Tech Stack**
Flutter: A UI toolkit from Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase using the Dart programming language.

Firebase: A platform by Google offering a variety of backend services such as real-time databases, authentication, and cloud storage. 

GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket: Platforms that provide Git repository hosting, issue tracking, and collaboration features.

**Features:**
Habit Library: A collection of micro-habits across different categories (e.g., fitness, productivity, mindfulness, etc.), curated by experts. Users can choose habits they want to adopt, and the app will track their progress.
Customizable reminders: Users can set their preferred times for habit reminders, ensuring that they are nudged at the most convenient moments.
Streaks and rewards: Users receive virtual rewards and badges for maintaining streaks, encouraging them to stay consistent with their chosen habits.
Progress tracking: The app records the user's progress and provides visual representations of their achievements over time.
Social sharing and challenges: Users can invite friends to join the app, share their progress, and participate in challenges to stay motivated.

**Monetization Strategy:**
Freemium Model: Offer a free version with limited features (e.g., a limited number of habits and basic tracking). Users can upgrade to a premium subscription to unlock additional habits, enhanced tracking, and other advanced features.
Subscription Pricing: Offer monthly and yearly subscription plans, priced competitively to attract users while generating sufficient revenue.
